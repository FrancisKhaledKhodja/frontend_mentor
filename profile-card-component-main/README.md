## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I begin to learn and I use it grid to place my elements on the screen.

My difficulty was to compute the row's GRID of the card and to place correctly the svg background: when I change the size of the screen the position of the svg must not move relative to the card.
